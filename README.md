# Nigerian Election Voting System

## Project Overview
The Nigerian Election Voting System is a blockchain-powered platform designed to modernize the electoral process in Nigeria. By utilizing blockchain technology, this system ensures secure, transparent, and efficient voting. It provides tamper-proof election data and real-time results, promoting integrity and trust in the election process.

## Features
- **Voter Registration**: A secure system for citizens to register and verify their eligibility to vote.
- **Candidate Registration**: A transparent and verifiable process for political candidates.
- **Tamper-Proof Voting**: Blockchain ensures votes are securely recorded, anonymous, and immutable.
- **Real-Time Results**: Instant access to verified election results after voting ends.
- **Blockchain Security**: The use of blockchain guarantees the integrity and transparency of all election data, preventing fraud.

## Technologies Used
- **Solidity**: Used to write smart contracts for managing voter registration, voting, and tallying results.
- **Ethereum/Blockchain**: Blockchain technology ensures secure and transparent storage of votes and election data.

## How It Works
1. **Voter Registration**: Eligible citizens can register to vote on the platform after verifying their identity.
2. **Candidate Registration**: Political candidates undergo a verification process before registration, ensuring legitimacy.
3. **Voting**: Once registered, voters cast their votes through the platform, with each vote securely stored on the blockchain.
4. **Results**: After voting concludes, results are immediately available and can be accessed through the platform, ensuring transparency.
